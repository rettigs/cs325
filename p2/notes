for proof:
    prove that for each line that mergeVisible checks, it correctly determines its visibility (refer to proof from first assignment)
    prove that each line in the rest of each list is also invisible if an invisible line is found (refer to proof of claim 3)
    prove that mergevisible is only passed 2 sets of visible lines, since it only works in that situation (this is proven because algorithm 4 only calls mergevisible on lists of length 1 (which are trivially visible) or on the output of mergevisible (which we just proved to be a set of visible lines)
